# Mistral OCR Tool

This Python program allows you to select a PDF file, send it to Mistral's OCR API for text and image extraction, and save the resulting processed PDF file to a location of your choice. Big thanks to: https://github.com/mistralai/cookbook/blob/main/third_party/gradio/MistralOCR.md
